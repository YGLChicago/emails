# Bureaucracy Busters
## Government employees committed to overcoming red tape

### [] Purpose
We are here as members of the civic technology community, to apply our skills and knowledge from government service as private citizens, in support of civic technology projects in our communities. It is our goal to serve as a public sector consultancy at Chi Hack Night and provide a resource to civic hacktivists.

### [] Who are we?
We are a network of over 500 public sector employees in Chicago. Organized through [Young Government Leaders: Chicago](http://chigov.space), we represent government entities at the municipal, state, and federal levels. If you are a govie, check us out. We have contacts at most agencies with a presence in Chicago and are always looking for ways to be more inclusive.

### [] How we can work together (Hackers + Govies)
- You want to practice presenting your project to real, live, breathing government employees.
- You are stymied by bureaucracy: i.e. which form do I fill out?
- You are wondering about navigating inter (or intra) agency structures: i.e. am I taking the best approach to identifying a government partner?
- You need information: i.e. how do I complete a FOIA request?
- You have a question about government agency culture.
- You are fretting about how to communicate with the government.
- You are thinking about other things (we really do like to help).

### [] How you can find us
- We like to hang out in a group.
- We have a [YGL Logo](#) printed on a piece of paper nearby.
- We like to be in the mess hall or in the comfy chairs in the back/ sides of the presentation area.
- We are on the [Chi Hack Night Slack](https://chihacknight.slack.me) in the #gov-group channel. DM `@csethna` if you have trouble locating us.
